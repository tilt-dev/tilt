# Tiltfile Concepts

This doc describes concepts in the Tiltfile, expanding on the [Tutorial](tutorial.html). Unlike the [API Reference](api.html), it groups functions by themes and explains why you'd choose to use a function.

## Execution Model
`Tiltfile`s are written in [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark), a dialect of Python. Tilt executes the `Tiltfile` on startup.

Functions like `k8s_yaml` and `docker_build` register information. At the end of the execution, Tilt uses the resulting configuration. In addition to the final configuration, Tilt records file accesses; Tilt watches these files, and reexecutes when one changes (but not on every source file change).

Because your Tiltfile is a program, you can configure it with familiar constructs like loops, functions, arrays, etc. This makes Tilt more extensible than a configuration that requires hard-coding all possible options up-front.

## Deploy
The first function in a `Tiltfile` is generally a call to `k8s_yaml`. You can call `k8s_yaml` in a variety of ways, depending on how your project organizes or generates yaml. Let's look at some alternatives:

```python
# one static yaml file
k8s_yaml('app.yaml')

# multiple yaml files in one call
k8s_yaml(['foo.yaml', 'bar.yaml'])

# multiple yaml files in multiple calls
k8s_yaml('baz.yaml')
k8s_yaml('quux.yaml')

# call out to a built-in tool
k8s_yaml(kustomize('config_dir')) # built-in support for popular tools
k8s_yaml(helm('chart_dir'))
```

Tilt has built-in functions to generate kubernetes yaml with `kustomize` or `helm`. (If you think we're overlooking a popular tool, let us know so we can add it.)

## Custom Commands
If your project uses a custom tool to generate kubernetes yaml, you can still use Tilt. You don't have to wait for us to add support or fork Tilt and implement it yourself. Run a custom command with the `local` function:
```python
text = local('./foo.py') # runs command foo.py
k8s_yaml(text)
```

`local` runs a command, and returns its `stdout` as a Blob. (A Blob is a string but is interpreted by `k8s_yaml` as text instead of as a filename.) Note: Tilt doesn't know what files a command accesses, so you need to use the function `read_file` to record accesses. If you don't call `read_file`, Tilt won't reexecute the `Tiltfile` when those files change. For example, if `foo.py` depends on the files `config/base.yaml` and `data/versions.txt`:

```python
read_file('config/base.yaml')
read_file('data/versions.txt')
text = local('./foo.py')
k8s_yaml(text)
```

You can also use python features like list comprehensions. For example, if you have a script that generates yaml for one microservice at a time, you could do:

```python
# define a function that returns the config for one microservice
def microservice_config(name):
  # record file access, using python string substitution to generate filename
  read_file('config/%s.yaml' % name)
  # run the script with an argument
  return local('./config/generate.py %s' % name)

# define the service names
services = ['frontend', 'backend', 'users', 'graphql']

# loop over each service and register its config
[k8s_yaml(microservice_config(service)) for service in services]
```

Using `local` judiciously can let you use existing tools with Tilt, without having to rewrite or abandon them immediately.

## Build
The `docker_build` function aims to support most usages of docker. Here's a cheat-sheet that maps docker command lines to a `docker_build` call:

```python
# docker build -t companyname/frontend ./frontend
docker_build("companyname/frontend", "frontend")

# docker build -t companyname/frontend -f frontend/Dockerfile.dev frontend
docker_build("companyname/frontend", "frontend", dockerfile="frontend/Dockerfile.dev")

# docker build -t companyname/frontend --build-arg target=local frontend
docker_build("companyname/frontend", "frontend", build_args={"target": "local"})
```

You can combine multiple optional arguments.

## Resources
Tilt's UI makes it easier to find errors by grouping related status and output. E.g., when you edit a file, you want to know what error it caused, whether it's an error at build-time, deploy-time, or run-time. Tilt calls these groupings "Resources". Each Resource has a line in the UI that can be expanded and investigated.

Tilt generates these groups after executing your `Tiltfile`. We're actively working on how to group in ways that make the most intuitive sense, so the specific algorithm is in-flux. We'll expand this paragraph when it's more settled.

You can configure a resource with a call to `k8s_resource`. Today, the only relevant configuration is the argument `port_forwards`. Tilt supports a few alternatives:

```python
# connect localhost:9000 to the default container port
k8s_resource('frontend', port_forwards=9000)

# connect localhost:9000 to container port 8000
k8s_resource('frontend', port_forwards='9000:8000')

# connect localhost:9000 to container port 8000
# and localhost:9001 to container port 8001
k8s_resource('frontend', port_forwards=['9000:8000', '9001:8001'])
```

You can also use calls to `k8s_resource` to control the grouping of resources. This should only be necessary in extreme cases. Because it's in-flux, please reach out and we'll help you individually if you think this is necessary.

## Summary
Tilt's configuration is a program that connects your existing build and deploy configuration. We've made our functions ergonomic for simple cases and general enough to support a wide range of cases. If you're not sure how to accomplish something, we'd love to either help you find the right way, or add support for a case we've overlooked.
