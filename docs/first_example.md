Running your First Tilt Project
===============================

This tutorial assumes you already have `tilt` and its dependencies set up,
and configured for a local cluster.

For your first Tilt project, let's not worry about configuring a project just yet.
Let's look at a simple existing project and see how easy it is to
`tilt up` and go.

First, check out the Tilt repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt
cd tilt/integration/oneup
```

Under `integration`, Tilt has example projects that we use to run our integration tests.
We'll be looking at the [oneup](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/tree/master/integration/oneup) project
in `integration/oneup`.

In the oneup directory, run

```
tilt up oneup
```

Your terminal will turn into a status box that lets you watch your server come up. When it's ready,
you will see the status icon turn green. The logs in the botton pane will display
"Serving oneup on 8000."

Congratulations! You've run your first server with `tilt`.

Type `q` to quit the status box. When you're finished, run

```
tilt down oneup
```

to turn off the server.
