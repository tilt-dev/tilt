<span id="goals-of-this-document"></span><h2>Goals of This Document<a class="headerlink" href="#goals-of-this-document" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Windmill Engineering is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all of our users, contributors, followers, and Fans, regardless of: gender identity or expression; sexual orientation; disability; neurodivergence; physical appearance; body size; ethnicity; nationality; race; age; religion; level of technical experience; education; socio-economic status; or similar personal characteristics.</p>
<p>The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk effectively, productively, and respectfully.</p>
<p>The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.</p>
<p>The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical to the project; for Windmill to be successful, it needs contributors and users from all backgrounds.</p>
<p>We believe that healthy debate and disagreement are essential to a healthy project and community. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful. We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.</p>

<span id="our-pledge"></span><h3>Our Pledge<a class="headerlink" href="#our-pledge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodivergence, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, level of technical experience, education, socio-economic status, or similar personal characteristics.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-standards">
<span id="our-standards"></span><h3>Our Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#our-standards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
<li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>
<li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission (also known as “doxing”)</li>
<li>Deliberate <a class="reference external" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/transgender/misgendering#why-it-happens">misgendering</a>. This includes <a class="reference external" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/transgender/deadnaming">deadnaming</a> or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person’s gender. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle</li>
<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*hug*</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*backrub*</span></code>) without consent or after a request to stop</li>
<li>Threats of violence, both physical and psychological</li>
<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>
<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>
<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
</ul>
<p>Our open source community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>“Reverse” -isms, including “reverse racism,” “reverse sexism,” and “cisphobia”</li>
<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”</li>
<li>Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts</li>
<li>Communicating in a “tone” you don’t find congenial</li>
<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="our-responsibilities">
<span id="our-responsibilities"></span><h3>Our Responsibilities<a class="headerlink" href="#our-responsibilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scope">
<span id="scope"></span><h3>Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include: using an official project e-mail address; posting via an official social media account; or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.</p>
<p>This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the project maintainers have a reasonable belief that an individual’s behavior may have a negative impact on the project or its community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conflict-resolution">
<span id="conflict-resolution"></span><h3>Conflict Resolution<a class="headerlink" href="#conflict-resolution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the project’s Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>If you see someone violating the Code of Conduct, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.</p>
<p>Reports should be directed to <strong>conduct&#64;windmill.engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone’s safety, we may take action without notice.</p>
