# Example Projects

Tilt's best when you use it with your project. We've built our [Tutorial](tutorial.html) to make it easy to get started even if you've never used Tilt before. If you don't have such a project, but still want to try Tilt, this doc describes two example projects we've built that use Tilt.

These projects can also be useful to confirm Tilt is working as expected in your environment.

## oneup
Oneup is a simple app that starts one service.

First, check out the Tilt repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt
cd tilt/integration/oneup
```

Under `integration`, Tilt has example projects that we use to run our integration tests.
We'll be looking at the [oneup](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/tree/master/integration/oneup) project
in `integration/oneup`.

In the oneup directory, run

```
tilt up
```

Your terminal will turn into a status box that lets you watch your server come up. When it's ready,
you will see the status icon turn green. The logs in the botton pane will display
"Serving oneup on container port 8000."

Type `b` to open `oneup` in a browser window.
Your browser will open `http://localhost:8100`.
You should see the text `🍄 One-Up! 🍄`.

Congratulations! You've run your first server with `tilt`.

Type `q` to quit the status box. When you're finished, run

```
tilt down
```

to turn off the server.

## Servantes
[Servantes](https://github.com/windmilleng/servantes) is a personalized homepage app implemented with many microservices in multiple languages. You can run it with the commands

```
git clone https://github.com/windmilleng/servantes
cd servantes; tilt up
```

Each widget is implemented by a different microservice backend.

Servantes uses many features of Tilt, and so can be a useful reference.
