# From Skaffold
## Before you begin
* [Install Tilt](install.html)
* If you're new to Tilt try stepping through [a Simple Tiltfile](first_config.html) first.

## Differences between Skaffold and Tilt
* Skaffold streams the logs for all services it started. We found one combined stream of all services difficult to use and understand for anything beyond the most simple apps. Tilt instead provides a UI right in your console to view all of your running services and other relevant errors in addition to the log view that Skaffold provides.
* Skaffold is configured with a static YAML config. Tilt is configured with a `Tiltfile`, written in a small subset of Python called [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark#tour>).

## Migrate from Skaffold to Tilt
Let's take a simple `skaffold.yaml` file with one service:

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v1alpha5
kind: Config
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: gcr.io/windmill-public-containers/servantes/snack
    context: . # This is the default if not specified
    docker:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile # This is the default if not specified
deploy:
  kubectl:
    manifests:
      - ./deployments/snack.yaml
```

1. Create a `Tiltfile`
2. Define your service name

In Skaffold services are implicitly named from their Kubernetes config. In Tilt services have names given by a function defined in your Tiltfile:

```python
def snack():
```

3. Set the build context

In Skaffold you can specify your build context and Dockerfile like so:

```yaml
build:
  artifacts:
  - image: gcr.io/windmill-public-containers/servantes/snack
    context: . # This is the default if not specified
    docker:
      dockerfile: Dockerfile # This is the default if not specified
```

In Tilt you tell us where your Dockerfile is and what the build_context is.

```python
  img = static_build("Dockerfile", "gcr.io/windmill-public-containers/servantes/snack", context=".")
```

4. Combine your build context and k8s config to create a service

In Skaffold you specify your Kubernetes YAML under the `manifests` key:

```yaml
deploy:
  kubectl:
    manifests:
      - ./deployments/snack.yaml
```

In Tilt we similarly associate your image and your Kubernetes YAML through the concept of a service:

```python
  yaml = read_file('./deployments/snack.yaml')
  service = k8s_service(img, yaml=yaml)
```

5. Return your service!

```python
  return service
```

All in all your `Tiltfile` should now look like this:

```python
def snack():
  img = static_build("Dockerfile", "gcr.io/windmill-public-containers/servantes/snack", context=".")
  yaml = read_file('./deployments/snack.yaml')
  service = k8s_service(img, yaml=yaml)
  return service
```
