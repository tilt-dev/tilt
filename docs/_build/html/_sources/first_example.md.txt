Running your First Tilt Project
===============================

Prerequisites
-------------

For this tutorial, you should have:

- [Installed `tilt`](install.html)
- Configured `kubectl` for a local cluster

To double-check, run:

```
$ tilt version
v0.5.0-dev, built 2019-01-14
$ kubectl config current-context
docker-for-desktop
```

If the cluster is NOT `docker-for-desktop`, `docker-desktop`, or `minikube`,
see the FAQ on
[how to change your cluster](faq.html#q-how-do-i-change-what-kubernetes-cluster-tilt-uses).
This example will only work with these local clusters.

Starting One Server
-------------------

For your first Tilt project, let's not worry about configuring a project just
yet.  Let's look at a simple existing project and see how easy it is to `tilt
up` and go.

First, check out the Tilt repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt
cd tilt/integration/oneup
```

Under `integration`, Tilt has example projects that we use to run our integration tests.
We'll be looking at the [oneup](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/tree/master/integration/oneup) project
in `integration/oneup`.

In the oneup directory, run

```
tilt up
```

Your terminal will turn into a status box that lets you watch your server come up. When it's ready,
you will see the status icon turn green. The logs in the botton pane will display
"Serving oneup on container port 8000."

Type `b` to open `oneup` in a browser window.
Your browser will open `http://localhost:8100`.
You should see the text `üçÑ One-Up! üçÑ`.

Congratulations! You've run your first server with `tilt`.

Type `q` to quit the status box. When you're finished, run

```
tilt down
```

to turn off the server.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If any of the examples in this tutorial didn't work for you, see the
[Troubleshooting FAQ](faq.html#Troubleshooting).

Next Steps
----------

How did Tilt know how to build the server?
How did it get into the Kubernetes cluster?
How did it start listening on `localhost:8100`?

In the next guide, we'll answer these questions while you learn
[how to configure your own project](first_config.html)
with Tilt.
