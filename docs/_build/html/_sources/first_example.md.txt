Running your First Tilt Project
===============================

This tutorial assumes you already have `tilt` and its dependencies set up,
and configured for a local cluster.

For your first Tilt project, let's not worry about configuring a project just yet.
Let's look at a simple existing project and see how easy it is to
`tilt up` and go.

First, check out the Tilt repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt
cd tilt/integration/oneup
```

Under `integration`, Tilt has example projects that we use to run our integration tests.
We'll be looking at the [oneup](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/tree/master/integration/oneup) project
in `integration/oneup`.

In the oneup directory, run

```
tilt up
```

Your terminal will turn into a status box that lets you watch your server come up. When it's ready,
you will see the status icon turn green. The logs in the botton pane will display
"Serving oneup on container port 8000."

Type `b` to open `oneup` in a browser window.
Your browser will open `http://localhost:8100`.
You should see the text `üçÑ One-Up! üçÑ`.

Congratulations! You've run your first server with `tilt`.

Type `q` to quit the status box. When you're finished, run

```
tilt down
```

to turn off the server.


Next Steps
----------

How did Tilt know how to build the server?
How did it get into the Kubernetes cluster?
How did it start listening on `localhost:8100`?

In the next guide, we'll answer these questions while you learn 
[how to configure your own project](first_config.html)
with Tilt.
