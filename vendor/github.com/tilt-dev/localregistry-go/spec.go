// LocalRegistryHostingV1 describes a local registry that developer tools can
// connect to. A local registry allows clients to load images into the local
// cluster by pushing to this registry.
type LocalRegistryHostingV1 struct {
	// Host documents the host (hostname and port) of the registry, as seen from
	// outside the cluster.
	//
	// This is the registry host that tools outside the cluster should push images
	// to.
	Host string `yaml:"host,omitempty"`

	// HostFromClusterNetwork documents the host (hostname and port) of the
	// registry, as seen from networking inside the container pods.
	//
	// This is the registry host that tools running on pods inside the cluster
	// should push images to. If not set, then tools inside the cluster should
	// assume the local registry is not available to them.
	HostFromClusterNetwork string `yaml:"hostFromClusterNetwork,omitempty"`

	// HostFromContainerRuntime documents the host (hostname and port) of the
	// registry, as seen from the cluster's container runtime.
	//
	// When tools apply Kubernetes objects to the cluster, this host should be
	// used for image name fields. If not set, users of this field should use the
	// value of Host instead.
	//
	// Note that it doesn't make sense semantically to define this field, but not
	// define Host or HostFromClusterNetwork. That would imply a way to pull
	// images without a way to push images.
	HostFromContainerRuntime string `yaml:"hostFromContainerRuntime,omitempty"`

	// Help contains a URL pointing to documentation for users on how to set
	// up and configure a local registry.
	//
	// Tools can use this to nudge users to enable the registry. When possible,
	// the writer should use as permanent a URL as possible to prevent drift
	// (e.g., a version control SHA).
	//
	// When image pushes to a registry host specified in one of the other fields
	// fail, the tool should display this help URL to the user. The help URL
	// should contain instructions on how to diagnose broken or misconfigured
	// registries.
	Help string `yaml:"help,omitempty"`
