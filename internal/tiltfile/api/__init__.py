  For more information on the `ignore` and `only` parameters, see our `Guide to File Changes </file_changes.html>`_.

  Note that you can't set both the `dockerfile` and `dockerfile_contents` arguments (will throw an error).

  Note also that the `entrypoint` parameter is not supported for Docker Compose resources.

  When using Docker Compose, Tilt expects the image build to be either managed by your Docker Compose file (via the `build <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#build>`_ key) OR by Tilt's :meth:`docker_build`, but not both. (Follow this `GitHub issue <https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt/issues/5196>`_ to be notified of changes to this expectation.)

  Finally, Tilt will put the image in a place where the target runtime can access it. Tilt will make a best effort to detect what kind of runtime you're using (Docker Compose, Kind, GKE, etc), and pick the best strategy for getting the image into it fast. See https://docs.tilt.dev/choosing_clusters.html for more info.

  Args:
    ref: name for this image (e.g. 'myproj/backend' or 'myregistry/myproj/backend'). If this image will be used in a k8s resource(s), this ref must match the ``spec.container.image`` param for that resource(s).
    context: path to use as the Docker build context.
    build_args: build-time variables that are accessed like regular environment variables in the ``RUN`` instruction of the Dockerfile. See `the Docker Build Arg documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg>`_.
    dockerfile: path to the Dockerfile to build.
    dockerfile_contents: raw contents of the Dockerfile to use for this build.
    live_update: set of steps for updating a running container (see `Live Update documentation <live_update_reference.html>`_).
    match_in_env_vars: specifies that k8s objects can reference this image in their environment variables, and Tilt will handle those variables the same as it usually handles a k8s container spec's ``image`` s.
    ignore: set of file patterns that will be ignored, in addition to ``.git`` directory that's `ignored by default <file_changes.html#where-ignores-come-from>`_. Ignored files will not trigger builds and will not be included in images. Follows the `dockerignore syntax <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file>`_. Patterns will be evaluated relative to the ``context`` parameter.
    only: set of file paths that should be considered for the build. All other changes will not trigger a build and will not be included in images. Inverse of ignore parameter. Only accepts real paths, not file globs. Patterns will be evaluated relative to the ``context`` parameter.
    entrypoint: command to run when this container starts. Takes precedence over the container's ``CMD`` or ``ENTRYPOINT``, and over a `container command specified in k8s YAML <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/>`_. If specified as a string, will be evaluated in a shell context (e.g. ``entrypoint="foo.sh bar"`` will be executed in the container as ``/bin/sh -c 'foo.sh bar'``); if specified as a list, will be passed to the operating system as program name and args.
    target: Specify a build stage in the Dockerfile. Equivalent to the ``docker build --target`` flag.
    ssh: Include SSH secrets in your build. Use ssh='default' to clone private repositories inside a Dockerfile. Uses the syntax in the `docker build --ssh flag <https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#using-ssh-to-access-private-data-in-builds>`_.
    network: Set the networking mode for RUN instructions. Equivalent to the ``docker build --network`` flag.
    secret: Include secrets in your build in a way that won't show up in the image. Uses the same syntax as the `docker build --secret flag <https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#new-docker-build-secret-information>`_.
    extra_tag: Tag an image with one or more extra references after each build. Useful when running Tilt in a CI pipeline, where you want each image to be tagged with the pipeline ID so you can find it later. Uses the same syntax as the ``docker build --tag`` flag.
    container_args: args to run when this container starts. Takes precedence over a `container args specified in k8s YAML <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/>`_.
    cache_from: Cache image builds from a remote registry. Uses the same syntax as `docker build --cache-from flag <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#specifying-external-cache-sources>`_.
    pull: Force pull the latest version of parent images. Equivalent to the ``docker build --pull`` flag.
    platform: Target platform for build (e.g. ``linux/amd64``). Defaults to the value of the ``DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM`` environment variable. Equivalent to the ``docker build --platform`` flag.

  of one or more Kubernetes objects to deploy, and zero or more image build directives

  Tilt assembles Kubernetes resources automatically, as described in
  `Tiltfile Concepts: Resources <tiltfile_concepts.html#resources>`_. You may call

  create and configure a new one:

  - If configuring an automatically created resource: the ``workload`` parameter must be specified.

  Calling ``k8s_resource`` is *optional*; you can use this function to configure port forwarding for
  your resource, to rename it, or to adjust any of the other settings specified below, but in many cases,
  Tilt's default behavior is sufficient.

  For more examples, see `Tiltfile Concepts: Resources <tiltfile_concepts.html#resources>`_.

  Args:
    workload: The name of an existing auto-assembled resource to configure
      (Tilt generates resource names when it `assembles resources by workload <tiltfile_concepts.html#resources>`_).
      (If you instead want to create/configure a _new_ resource, use the ``objects`` parameter
      in conjunction with ``new_name``.)
    new_name: If non-empty, will be used as the new name for this resource. (To
      programmatically rename all resources, see :meth:`workload_to_resource_function`.)
    port_forwards: Host port to connect to the pod. Takes 3 forms:

      ``'9000'`` (port only) - Connect localhost:9000 to the container's port 9000,
      if it is exposed. Otherwise connect to the container's default port.

      ``'9000:8000'`` (host port to container port) - Connect localhost:9000 to the container port 8000).

      ``'elastic.local:9200:8000'`` (host address to container port) - Bind elasticsearch:9200 on the host
      to container port 8000. You will also need to update /etc/host to make 'elastic.local' point to localhost.

      Multiple port forwards can be specified (e.g., ``['9000:8000', '9001:8001']``).
      The string-based syntax is sugar over the more explicit ``port_forward(9000, 8000)``.
    extra_pod_selectors: In addition to relying on Tilt's heuristics to automatically
      find Kubernetes resources associated with this resource, a user may specify extra
      labelsets to force pods to be associated with this resource. An pod
      will be associated with this resource if it has all of the labels in at
      least one of the entries specified (but still also if it meets any of
      Tilt's usual mechanisms).
    trigger_mode: One of ``TRIGGER_MODE_AUTO`` or ``TRIGGER_MODE_MANUAL``. For more info, see the
      `Manual Update Control docs <manual_update_control.html>`_.
    resource_deps: A list of resources on which this resource depends.
      See the `Resource Dependencies docs <resource_dependencies.html>`_.
    objects: A list of Kubernetes objects to be added to this resource, specified via
      Tilt's `Kubernetes Object Selector <tiltfile_concepts.html#kubernetes-object-selectors>`_
      syntax. If the ``workload`` parameter is specified, these objects will be
      added to the existing resource; otherwise, these objects will form a new
      resource with name ``new_name``. If an object selector matches more than
      one Kubernetes object, or matches an object already associated with a
      resource, ``k8s_resource`` raises an error.
    auto_init: whether this resource runs on ``tilt up``. Defaults to ``True``. For more info, see the
      `Manual Update Control docs <manual_update_control.html>`_.
    pod_readiness: Possible values: 'ignore', 'wait'. Controls whether Tilt waits for
      pods to be ready before the resource is considered healthy (and dependencies
      can start building). By default, Tilt will wait for pods to be ready if it
      thinks a resource has pods.
    links: one or more links to be associated with this resource in the UI. For more info, see
      `Accessing Resource Endpoints <accessing_resource_endpoints.html#arbitrary-links>`_.
    labels: used to group resources in the Web UI, (e.g. you want all frontend services displayed together, while test and backend services are displayed separately). A label must start and end with an alphanumeric character, can include ``_``, ``-``, and ``.``, and must be 63 characters or less. For an example, see `Resource Grouping <tiltfile_concepts.html#resource-groups>`_.
    discovery_strategy: Possible values: '', 'default', 'selectors-only'. When '' or 'default', Tilt both uses `extra_pod_selectors` and traces k8s owner references to identify this resource's pods. When 'selectors-only', Tilt uses only `extra_pod_selectors`.

  Please read the `Custom Image Builders Guide <custom_build.html>`_ on how to
  use this function.

  All custom build scripts build an image and put it somewhere. But there are
  several different patterns for where they put the image, how they compute a
  digest of the contents, and how they push the image to the
  cluster. ``custom_build`` has many options to support different combinations
  of each mode. The guide has some examples of common combinations.

  Args:
    ref: name for this image (e.g. 'myproj/backend' or 'myregistry/myproj/backend'). If this image will be used in a k8s resource(s), this ref must match the ``spec.container.image`` param for that resource(s).
    command: a command that, when run in the shell, builds an image puts it in the registry as ``ref``. In the
      default mode, must produce an image named ``$EXPECTED_REF``.  If a string, executed with ``sh -c`` on macOS/Linux,
      or ``cmd /S /C`` on Windows; if a list, will be passed to the operating system as program name and args.
    deps: a list of files or directories to be added as dependencies to this image. Tilt will watch those files and will rebuild the image when they change. Only accepts real paths, not file globs.
    tag: Some tools can't change the image tag at runtime. They need a pre-specified tag. Tilt will set ``$EXPECTED_REF = image_name:tag``,
       then re-tag it with its own tag before pushing to your cluster.
    disable_push: whether Tilt should push the image in to the registry that the Kubernetes cluster has access to. Set this to true if your command handles pushing as well.
    skips_local_docker: Whether your build command writes the image to your local Docker image store. Set this to true if you're using a cloud-based builder or independent image builder like ``buildah``.
    live_update: set of steps for updating a running container (see `Live Update documentation <live_update_reference.html>`_).
    match_in_env_vars: specifies that k8s objects can reference this image in their environment variables, and Tilt will handle those variables the same as it usually handles a k8s container spec's ``image`` s.
    ignore: set of file patterns that will be ignored. Ignored files will not trigger builds and will not be included in images. Follows the `dockerignore syntax <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file>`_. Patterns/filepaths will be evaluated relative to each ``dep`` (e.g. if you specify ``deps=['dep1', 'dep2']`` and ``ignores=['foobar']``, Tilt will ignore both ``deps1/foobar`` and ``dep2/foobar``).
    entrypoint: command to run when this container starts. Takes precedence over the container's ``CMD`` or ``ENTRYPOINT``, and over a `container command specified in k8s YAML <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/>`_. If specified as a string, will be evaluated in a shell context (e.g. ``entrypoint="foo.sh bar"`` will be executed in the container as ``/bin/sh -c 'foo.sh bar'``); if specified as a list, will be passed to the operating system as program name and args. Kubernetes-only.
    command_bat_val: Deprecated, use command_bat.
    outputs_image_ref_to: Specifies a file path. When set, the custom build command must write a content-based
      tagged image ref to this file. Tilt will read that file after the cmd runs to get the image ref,
      and inject that image ref into the YAML. For more on content-based tags, see `why tilt uses immutable tags <custom_build.html#why-tilt-uses-immutable-tags>`_
    command_bat: If non-empty and on Windows, takes precedence over ``command``. Ignored on other platforms.
      If a string, executed as a Windows batch command executed with ``cmd /S /C``; if a list, will be passed to
      the operating system as program name and args.
    image_deps: a list of image builds that this deploy depends on.
      The tagged image names will be injected into the environment of the
      the custom build command in the form:

      `TILT_IMAGE_i` - The reference to the image #i (0-based) from the point of view of the local host.

  - if `cmd` is non-empty, it is executed
  - if `cmd` succeeds:
    - Tilt kills any extant `serve_cmd` process from previous updates of this resource
    - if `serve_cmd` is non-empty, it is executed

  For more info, see the `Local Resource docs <local_resource.html>`_.

  Args:
    name: will be used as the new name for this resource

    deps: a list of files or directories to be added as dependencies to this cmd. Tilt will watch those files and will run the cmd when they change. Only accepts real paths, not file globs.
    trigger_mode: one of ``TRIGGER_MODE_AUTO`` or ``TRIGGER_MODE_MANUAL``. For more info, see the
      `Manual Update Control docs <manual_update_control.html>`_.
    resource_deps: a list of resources on which this resource depends.
      See the `Resource Dependencies docs <resource_dependencies.html>`_.
    ignore: set of file patterns that will be ignored. Ignored files will not trigger runs. Follows the `dockerignore syntax <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file>`_. Patterns will be evaluated relative to the Tiltfile.
    auto_init: whether this resource runs on ``tilt up``. Defaults to ``True``. For more info, see the
      `Manual Update Control docs <manual_update_control.html>`_.
    serve_cmd: Tilt will run this command on update and expect it to not exit. If a string, executed with
      ``sh -c`` on macOS/Linux, or ``cmd /S /C`` on Windows; if a list, will be passed to the operating
      system as program name and args.
    cmd_bat: If non-empty and on Windows, takes precedence over ``cmd``. Ignored on other platforms.
      If a string, executed as a Windows batch command executed with ``cmd /S /C``; if a list, will be passed to
      the operating system as program name and args.
    serve_cmd_bat: If non-empty and on Windows, takes precedence over ``serve_cmd``. Ignored on other platforms.
      If a string, executed as a Windows batch command executed with ``cmd /S /C``; if a list, will be passed to
      the operating system as program name and args.
    allow_parallel: By default, all local resources are presumed unsafe to run in parallel, due to race
      conditions around modifying a shared file system. Set to True to allow them to run in parallel.
    links: one or more links to be associated with this resource in the Web UI (e.g. perhaps you have a "reset database" workflow and want to attach a link to the database web console). Provide one or more strings (the URLs to link to) or :class:`~api.Link` objects.
    env: Environment variables to pass to the executed ``cmd``. Values specified here will override any variables passed to the Tilt parent process.
    serve_env: Environment variables to pass to the executed ``serve_cmd``. Values specified here will override any variables passed to the Tilt parent process.
    readiness_probe: Optional readiness probe to use for determining ``serve_cmd`` health state. Fore more info, see the :meth:`probe` function.
    dir: Working directory for ``cmd``. Defaults to the Tiltfile directory.
    serve_dir: Working directory for ``serve_cmd``. Defaults to the Tiltfile directory.
    labels: used to group resources in the Web UI, (e.g. you want all frontend services displayed together, while test and backend services are displayed separately). A label must start and end with an alphanumeric character, can include ``_``, ``-``, and ``.``, and must be 63 characters or less.
