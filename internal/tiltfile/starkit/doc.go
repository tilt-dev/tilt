// Starkit is a toolkit for implementing Starlark interpreters, with support for:
//
// (1) reusable sets of builtins
// (2) collecting state on a starlark thread
// (3) instrumenting builtins with analytics
//
// So that builtins from different packages can be composed.
//
// This package is designed to eventually be a separate repo.
