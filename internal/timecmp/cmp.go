// Package timecmp provides utility functions for comparing apiserver and stdlib times.
//
// There are a couple big pitfalls when using apiserver time types.
//
// First, the apiserver time types (metav1.Time & metav1.MicroTime) have second and microsecond
// granularity once serialized, respectively. Internally, however, they are wrappers around
// the Go stdlib times. As a result, initialized values that have not yet round-tripped to
// the server can have more granularity than they should.
//
// To address this issue, there are convenience constructors in tilt/pkg/apis that should be
// used for conversions from Go stdlib time types, including Now(). These are similar to the
// ones provided by metav1 itself except that they _immediately_ truncate.
//
// The second issue is addressed by this package, which is that internal timestamps within
// the Tilt engine often have higher granularity, which means comparisons can be problematic.
// For example, if an internal timestamp of an operation is held as a Go stdlib time.Time value
// and then stored on an entity as a metav1.Time object, future comparisons might not behave as
// expected since the latter value will be truncated.
//
// The comparison functions provided by this package normalize values to the lowest granularity
// of the values being compared before performing the actual comparison.
