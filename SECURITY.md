# Responsible Disclosure Policy

Data security is a top priority for the Tilt project.  We believe that working
with skilled security researchers can identify weaknesses in any technology.

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in Tilt or in any cloud
service that Tilt sends data to, please notify us. We will work with you to
resolve the issue promptly.

## Disclosure Policy

- If you believe you've discovered a potential vulnerability, please
  let us know by emailing us at security@tilt.dev. We will
  acknowledge your email within 3 days.

- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before
  disclosing it to the public or a third party. We aim to resolve critical
  issues within 30 days of disclosure.

- Make a good faith effort to avoid violating privacy, destroying
  data, or interrupting or degrading Tilt services. Please
  only interact with accounts you own or for which you have explicit
  permission from the account holder.

## Exclusions

While researching, we'd like you to refrain from:

- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

- Spamming

- Social engineering or phishing of Docker employees or
  contractors

- Any attacks against physical property

Thank you for helping to keep Tilt and our users safe!

## Changes

We may revise these guidelines from time to time. The most current
version of the guidelines will be available at https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt/blob/master/SECURITY.md.
