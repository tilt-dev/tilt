Kubernetes for Prod, Tilt for Dev

Modern apps are made of too many services. They're everywhere and in constant
communication.

[Tilt](https://tilt.dev) powers multi-service development and makes sure they behave!
Run `tilt up` to work in a complete dev environment configured for your team.

Tilt automates all the steps from a code change to a new process: watching
files, building container images, and bringing your environment
up-to-date. Think `docker build && kubectl apply` or `docker-compose up`.

[![Tilt Cloud](assets/TiltCloud-illustration.svg)](https://docs.tilt.dev/snapshots.html)

Are you seeing an error from a server that you don't even work on?

With Tilt Cloud, create web-based interactive reproductions of your local cluster’s state.

Save and share [a snapshot](https://docs.tilt.dev/snapshots.html) with your team
so that they can dig into the problem later. A snapshot lets you explore the
status of running services, errors, logs, and more.
