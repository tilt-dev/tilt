## Installing Tilt

Tilt binaries are available for MacOS and Linux

[Download the latest Tilt command for your platform](https://github.com/windmilleng/tilt/releases/latest)

### Compiling from source

If you'd prefer to install Tilt from source,

- Install [go 1.11](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Run `go get -u github.com/windmilleng/tilt`

## Using Tilt

`tilt up <service_name>` starts a service and watches for changes.

`tilt up --watch=false <service_name>` starts the service once.

Tilt reads from a Tiltfile. A simple Tiltfile is below:

```python
def backend():
  img = static_build('Dockerfile', 'gcr.io/companyname/backend')
  yaml = read_file('backend.yaml')
  return k8s_service(img, yaml=yaml)
```

## Optimizing Tilt

Building with the `Tiltfile` above may be slow because it builds a new image each time.

With a `Tiltfile` that uses `start_fast_build`, Tilt is able to optimize your build so
that it only runs the steps that have changed.

```python
def backend():
  start_fast_build('Dockerfile', 'gcr.io/companyname/backend', '/go/bin/server')
  repo = local_git_repo('.')
  add(repo, '/go/src/github.com/companyname/backend')
  run('cd /go/src/github.com/companyname/backend && npm install .',
      trigger=['package.json'])
  run('go install github.com/companyname/backend/server')
  img = stop_build()
  img.cache('/root/.cache/go-cache')

  yaml = read_file('backend.yaml')
  s = k8s_service(img, yaml=yaml)
  s.port_forward(8080, 80)
  return s
```

## Mill

written in a Mill, a dialect of python. It's based on [starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark), using the implementation in [go](https://github.com/google/skylark).

### Mill Builtins

Mill comes with built-in functions.

#### static_build(dockerfile, ref, build_args?, context?)
Builds a docker image.

```python
def static_build(dockerfile: str, ref: str, build_args: Dict[str, str] = {}, context: str = "") -> Image:
      """Builds a docker image.

    Args:
      dockerfile: The path to a Dockerfile
      ref: e.g. a blorgdev/backend or gcr.io/project-name/bucket-name
      build_args?: the build-time variables that are accessed like regular environment variables in the `RUN` instruction of the Dockerfile. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg
      context?: The path to use as the Docker build context. Defaults to the Dockerfile directory.
    Returns:
      Image
    """
```

#### local_git_repo
Creates a `repo` from the git repo at `path`.

```python
def local_git_repo(path: str) -> Repo
```

#### Repo
Represents a local code repository

```python
class Repo:
  def path(path: str) -> localPath:
    """Returns the absolute path to the file specified at `path` in the repo.
    path must be a relative path.

    Args:
      path: relative path in repository
    Returns:
      A localPath resource, representing a local path on disk.
    """
```

#### start_fast_build

Initiates a docker image build that supports `add`s and `run`s, and that uses a cache for subsequent builds.

TODO(dmiller): explain how this is fast, and image vs container builds?

TODO(dmiller): explain the concept of the active build

```python
def start_fast_build(dockerfile_path: str, img_name: str, entrypoint: str = "") -> None
```

#### add

Adds the content from `src` into the image at path `dest`.

```python
def add(src: Union[localPath, Repo], dest: str) -> None
```

#### run

Runs `cmd` as a build step in the image.
If the `trigger` argument is specified, the build step is only run on changes to the given file(s).

```python
def run(cmd: str, trigger: Union[List[str], str] = []) -> None
```

#### Service

Represents a Kubernetes service that Tilt can deploy and monitor.

```python
class Service
  def port_forward(local: int, remote: int = 0):
    """Sets up port-forwarding for the deployed container when it's ready.

    Args:
      local: The local port
      remote: The container port. If not specified, we will forward to the first port in the container
    """
```

#### global_yaml
Call this _on the top level of your Tiltfile_ with a string of YAML.

We will infer what (if any) of the k8s resources defined in your YAML correspond to `Services` defined elsewhere in your Tiltfile (matching based on the DockerImage ref and on pod selectors). Any remaining YAML is _global YAML_, i.e. YAML that Tilt applies to your k8s cluster independently of any `Service` you define.
```python
def global_yaml(yaml: string) -> None
```

#### k8s_service

Creates a kubernetes service that tilt can deploy using the the image passed in. Optionally, you may also pass the Kubernetes resource YAML. If the YAML is not passed, we expect to be able to extract it from `global_yaml` (see above).

```python
def k8s_service(img: Image, yaml: string="") -> Service
```

#### Image

Represents a built Docker image

```python
class Image
  def cache(path: string) -> None:
    """Caches the given path between image builds.

    Popular directories to cache include:
    - Go projects: /root/.cache/go-cache
    - NodeJS projects: /src/node_modules, /src/yarn.lock

    Args:
      path: The path to cache. May be a file or a directory.
    """
```

#### composite_service

Creates a composite service; tilt will deploy (and watch) all services returned by the functions in `service_fns`.

```python
def composite_service(List[Callable[[], Service]]) -> Service
```

#### local

Runs cmd, waits for it to finish, and returns its stdout.

```python
def local(cmd: str) -> str
```

#### read_file

Reads file and returns its contents.

```python
def read_file(file_path: str) -> str
```

#### stop_build()

Closes the currently active build and returns a container Image that has all of the adds and runs applied.

```python
def stop_build() -> Image
```

#### kustomize()

Run [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) on a given directory and return the resulting YAML.

```python
def kustomize(pathToDir: str) -> str
```

This tool can send usage reports to https://events.windmill.build, to help us
understand what features people use. We only report on which `tilt` commands
run and how long they run for.

You can enable usage reports by running

```
tilt analytics opt in
